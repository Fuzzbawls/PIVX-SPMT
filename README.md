# SPMT

**SPMT: Secure Pivx Masternode Tool is a software to securely manage multiple PIVX masternodes while keeping the collateral safely stored on hardware wallets.<br>Currently supported wallets:**
 - [LEDGER](https://www.ledger.com) Nano S / Nano X
 - [TREZOR](https://trezor.io) One / Model T [*]

[*] Only with firmware versions up to **2.3.4** for Model T and **1.9.3** for Trezor one

<p>Running a PIVX masternode usually requires setting up two PIVX full nodes: </p>

1) the *Masternode*, that runs 24/7 (usually on a VPS) and holds no funds

2) the *Control Wallet*, that holds the collateral and does not need to be always on-line. <br>
It is used only to spend rewards, to vote on proposals, or to send a message (signed with the key of the collateral) to activate the remote node when it needs to be started.

<p>SPMT allows the user to store the keys of the collateral on an hardware wallet thus replaces the control wallet, allowing the user:</p>

- to sign with the collateral private key the start-message for the remote node and broadcast it.
- to spend masternode rewards without inadvertently including the collateral.
- to interact with the PIVX governance system reviewing proposals and budgets, and casting votes.

The tool connects to the PIVX blockchain through public remote servers but it's also possible to use a local running PIVX full node as RPC server or add customized remote servers. <br>
